# Automating my workflow with python
## How it works
on running the file it asks you what you want to name your project and weather you want to initialize it with npm or python.
It automatically logs in to github and creates a new repo.
Then it creates a local directory with the name of the project.
It then initializes a README.md and if you have chosen to activate python or node it will do that as well.
Then it will push the files to the repo
